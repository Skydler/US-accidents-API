# US-accidents-API
API made to query a dataset of US accidents

## Requirements
 - [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
 - [database-tools](https://docs.mongodb.com/database-tools/installation/#install-tools)
 - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Installation
```sh
    bash ./install.sh PATH_TO_CSV_FILE
```

Installation will import the csv data on "accidents" collection under "accidents" db 

You should also create a `.env` file with the corresponding server configuration. See `.env.example` for an example.

## Usage
```sh
    node index.js
```

This will start the API server on port 3000

## Clarifications
We had to modify the Mongo collection schema by adding two geo points to all the accidents. Some of them already had an end point, but in those cases where they don't, we used the start point.
